# Surfs Up - Oahu Analysis
## Module 9 Challenge

### June Statistical Data
The average temperature is 74.9 deg F with a standard deviation of 3.25. The min temp is 64 and max temp is 85 deg F.
The average precipitation is 0.136 in with a standard deviation of 0.33. The max measured precipitation is 4.43 in.

### December Statistical Data
The average temperature is 71.0 deg F with a standard deviation of 3.74. The min temp is 56 and max temp is 83 deg F.
The average precipitation is 0.217 in with a standard deviation of 0.54. The max measured precipitation is 6.42 in.

### Key Differences
June is nearly 4 degrees hotter on average and has nearly 40% less precipitation. December has more variability (i.e. larger range) in temperature and precipitation.

### Recommendations
1) **Analyze weather in each month by cluster weather stations**. Oahu has different climate zones due to its unique island layout. It is possible certain weather stations are skewing the overall data. We need to filter to stations located in the areas we want to open a Surf Shop.
2) **Analyze temperature and precipitation trends year-round**. We will be able to determine if changes in temperature or precipitation are gradual or drastic or what is the frequency of "bad" weather by month. This analysis will give us a more hollistic view of the business case.
3) **Gather and analyze tidal data**. The SURF!!! The swell in the ocean is the most critical piece of data to attract surfers to your local surf shop. We need to add it to our data set.
